## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
[Issues](https://github.com/formove-ai/STM32_BNO085/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
[open a new one](https://github.com/formove-ai/STM32_BNO085/issues/new). Be sure to
include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible,
and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected
behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.
Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the
stability, functionality, or testability of this library will generally not
be accepted.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change to the autors and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about
the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

## **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* You can ask the autors a question about how to use the library.

Thanks! :heart:
